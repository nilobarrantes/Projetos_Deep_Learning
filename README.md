# Nilo Barrantes Melgar
<sub>*Jr Data Scientist*</sub>

As an experienced master's and doctoral researcher, I combine analytical skills, strong logical-mathematical reasoning, ability to work under pressure and attention to details. Having spend the last years studying how to improve existing neural network models, I developed critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

My credentials include a PHD's in Physics in the field of Neural Network from the Brazilian Center for Research in Physics (CBPF), a pioneer institution in the development of scientific research in theoretical and experimental physics in Brazil, and a Master's in Physics in the field of Nonextensive statistical mechanics from the CBPF.

**Background in:** Python, Machine Learning, Neural Network, Computational Physics and Mathematical Optimization.
